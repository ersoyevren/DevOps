# Hands-on Ansible-01: To Install Ansible and Ansible Basic Operations

The purpose of this hands-on training is to give students knowledge of basic Ansible skills.

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of this hands-on training, students will be able to;

- Explain what Ansible can do
- Learn basic Ad-hoc commands  

## Outline

- Part 1 - Install Ansible

- Part 2 - Ansible Ad-hoc Commands

## Part 1 - Install Ansible


- Spin-up 3 Amazon Linux 2 instances and name them as:
    1. control node
    2. node1 ----> (SSH PORT 22, HTTP PORT 80)
    3. node2 ----> (SSH PORT 22, HTTP PORT 80)


- Connect to the control node via SSH and run the following commands.

```bash
sudo yum update -y
sudo amazon-linux-extras install ansible2

# guncelleme yapip ansibleyi kuruyoruz.
```

### Confirm Installation

- To confirm the successful installation of Ansible, run the following command.

```bash
$ ansible --version
```
Stdout:
```
ansible 2.9.12
  config file = /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
  configured module search path = [u'/home/ec2-user/.ansible/plugins/modules', u'/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']
  ansible python module location = /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ansible
  executable location = /usr/bin/ansible
  python version = 2.7.18 (default, Aug 27 2020, 21:22:52) [GCC 7.3.1 20180712 (Red Hat 7.3.1-9)]
```
- Explain the lines above:
    1. Version Number of Ansible
    2. Path for the Ansible Config File
    3. Modules are searched in this order
    4. Ansible's Python Module path
    5. Ansible's executable file path
    6. Ansible's Python version with GNU Compiler Collection for Red Hat

### Configure Ansible on the Control Node

- Connect to the control node for building a basic inventory.

- Edit ```/etc/ansible/hosts``` file by appending the connection information of the remote systems to be managed.

- Along with the hands-on, public or private IPs can be used.

```bash
$ sudo su
$ cd /etc/ansible
$ ls
$ vim hosts
[webservers]
node1 ansible_host=<node1_ip> ansible_user=ec2-user
node2 ansible_host=<node2_ip> ansible_user=ec2-user

[all:vars]
ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/home/ec2-user/<pem file>
# Burada tum hosts larda bu keyi kullan demek
```

- Explain what ```ansible_host```, ```ansible_user``` and ansible_ssh_key_file parameters are. For this reason visit the Ansible's [inventory parameters web site](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_inventory.html#connecting-to-hosts-behavioral-inventory-parameters).

- Explain what an ```alias``` (node1 and node2) is and where we use it.

- Explain what ```[webservers] and [all:vars]``` expressions are. Elaborate the concepts of [group name](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_inventory.html#inventory-basics-formats-hosts-and-groups), [group variables](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_inventory.html#assigning-a-variable-to-many-machines-group-variables) and [default groups](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_inventory.html#default-groups). 

- Visit the above links for helping to understand the subject. 

- Copy your pem file to the Control Node. First, go to your pem file directory on your local PC and run the following command.

```bash
$ scp -i <pem file> <pem file> ec2-user@<public DNS name of Control Node>:/home/ec2-user
# burada yereldeki bilgisayarimizdan ec2 ya pem dosyamizi gonderiyoruz.
```
- Check if the file is transferred to the remote machine. 

- As an alternative way, create a file on the control node with the same name as the <pem file> in ```/etc/ansible``` directory. 

- Then copy the content of the pem file and paste it in the newly created pem file on the control node.
